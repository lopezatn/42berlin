# 42berlin

If you're a student from the academy and ended up in my github thanks to saint Google, read below:

The projects listed here might not be the same as the ones that you have. If they are, make sure that the rules that I follow here are also applied to you, because they could and probably have been changed.
42 is hard and if you're here its because you are clearly strugling to understand how things are done. All I can tell you is to: keep calm and trust in yourself, you will do just fine. (Read that again)


I wish you the very best of lucks and and may the odds be ever in your favor.
